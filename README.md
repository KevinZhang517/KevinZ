#Self-introduction-generator
An app can generate your self-introduction.
Language:Chinese!!!
As a beginner in Python, I have created two very simple programs. These programs can automatically generate .txt or .docx self-introduction files based on the information you provide. They are very simple and serve merely as a record of my learning achievements.
How to use:
After opening the .exe program, input the required information as prompted, and it will generate the file. 
Note: Please input information in Chinese, as the program outputs in Chinese. It is primarily intended for Chinese-speaking users!
